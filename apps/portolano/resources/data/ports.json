The port of Rijeka is the largest commercial port of Croatia but does not have a pleasure facilities. It is repaired by a long dam that runs parallel to the coast and consists of six basins of which the last is the real port of the city. As in the sailing channel you wanted between the Istrian coast and the island of Cres, the entrance to the port (and the Gulf of Rijeka) is on the tip for those who enter. The mouth of the Eneo river marks the beginning of the town of Susak who has a communicating port with that of river through a canal and is the usual site of the tugboats and the brajdic marina. Rijeka's lighthouse is a typical striped tower on a quadrangular characteristic block (in Lample, 15s, 15 m). The construction sites and repairs of Avarie are in Luka Brgud and Martinscica (45 * 18.7 N - 14 * 29 'E), respectively to the west and east of Rijeka. The local nautical club is in Zurkovo."

For boating it offers numerous possibilities for its jagged coast and rich in bays and anchors. The port of Hvar is very busy by ferries, tourist boats, yachts. In summer it is difficult to find mooring and may perhaps be a little in stand-by to be able to land. Located in a bay that has the protection of Pakleni islets is raveroed from the north by the mountain ridge of the island. The port is quack and the first part is reserved for ships. The pleasure boats moor on dead body in the interior part or in front of the hotels with a top of the ground. The Krizna Luka Baietta has some gavitelli in front of the fuel distributor that is combined with smaller boats. Instead, the anchorage is prohibited in the passage of the Galisnik islet. The stop is those not to be missed for the beauty of the city and the historic center. Every refueling is possible in shops and market and the rich fruit and vegetables market. On the docks there are bars and restaurants under palm trees. The anchors around Hvar are not lacking, to be reported mainly to the west those of Vela Garska which has a comprehensive pier well ravished by every wind and Pelegrin, an uninhabited bay which is open to the winds of the second and third quadrant. Other interesting anchors are on the small Spalmadori Archipelago (Pakleni Otoci)."
